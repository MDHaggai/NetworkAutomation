# NetworkAutomation
Orchestration, programmability and automation of an enterprise network 

1)Problem Statement 

Enterprise networks are increasingly complex and difficult to manage, particularly from a security 
perspective. Traditional network management practices are manual, prone to errors, and often 
inadequate in addressing the sophisticated and evolving security threats. There's a critical need for an 
approach that automates routine tasks, provides programmable control over network resources, enables 
rapid reconfiguration of network settings in response to changing security threats, and ensures 
consistent application of security policies across the network.


2)Objectives 

2.1 General Objective

To design and implement a framework for the orchestration, programmability, and automation of an 
enterprise network using GNS3, thereby not only increasing operational efficiency and reducing manual 
intervention but also significantly enhancing the network's security against evolving threats.

2.3 Specific Objectives

✓ To develop a virtualized network environment in GNS3 that simulates an enterprise network, 
incorporating security at its core.
✓ To integrate network automation tools and scripts that support the automatic application and 
enforcement of security policies, configuration backups, and immediate response to security 
incidents.
✓ To implement network programmability features using secure APIs to enable dynamic control, 
management, and reconfiguration of network devices in real-time, based on security needs.
✓ To utilize network orchestration tools to manage and coordinate network services and resources 
efficiently, with a focus on security, across the simulated enterprise network.
2
✓ To ensure comprehensive monitoring and analytics for enhanced visibility and early detection of 
security threats.


3) Methodology, Tools, Equipment 

• Methodology: 
Adopting an iterative development process with a focus on security by design, 
incorporating phases of network design, security integration, simulation, automation scripting, 
and rigorous security testing.

• Tools:
✓ GNS3 for network simulation and modeling with security scenarios.
✓ Security-enhanced network automation tools like Ansible, Python (with security-focused 
libraries), to automate security policy application, incident response, and security 
configurations.
✓ RESTful APIs for secure programmable access to network devices.
✓ Security monitoring and analytics tools integrated into the simulated environment.


• Equipment: Computers with sufficient resources to run GNS3 simulations and security tools, 
and software environments for development and testing.


4) Basic Skills Needed 
✓ Deep understanding of network fundamentals, protocols, and security principles.
✓ Proficiency with GNS3 for simulating complex network environments with security 
considerations.
✓ Programming and scripting skills, especially Python, with a focus on writing secure automation 
scripts.
✓ Familiarity with implementing and managing network security policies, intrusion 
detection/prevention techniques, and responding to security incidents.
✓ Knowledge of secure coding practices and API security.


5) Awaited Results 

✓ A secure, fully functional simulated enterprise network in GNS3, equipped with advanced 
automation and programmability features focused on security.
✓ A demonstrable improvement in the network's resilience against security threats, with automated 
responses to incidents and consistent security policy enforcement.
✓ Enhanced network agility, enabling rapid adaptation of security configurations in response to 
emerging threats.
✓ Comprehensive documentation and guidelines for deploying, managing, and securing the network 
automation and programmability framework.
